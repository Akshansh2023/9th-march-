    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is commonly used as a model in various statistical and scientific fields. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",

    "Normal distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is widely used in various fields of science, social science, and engineering. It is essential because it describes the behavior of many real-world phenomena, making it a valuable tool for analyzing and interpreting data. Here are some examples of the importance of normal distribution:\n",

    "The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the outcomes of a random variable that can take only two possible values, typically 0 and 1. The probability of the variable taking the value 1 is denoted by the parameter p, and the probability of it taking the value 0 is 1-p.\n",

    "The main difference between Bernoulli distribution and binomial distribution is that Bernoulli distribution deals with a single trial, whereas binomial distribution deals with multiple independent trials, each having a Bernoulli distribution. Specifically, the binomial distribution describes the probability of obtaining a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each having a Bernoulli distribution. For example, tossing a coin 10 times and counting the number of times heads appear is an example of a binomial distribution with n=10 and p=0.5."
